Column labels and description of the column. 
Day - Day of testing over the course of the 2 day experiment.
Row - Position of the exposure chamber in the experiment. 
Column - Position of the exposure chamber in the experiment. 
Pesticide - Pesticide or metabolite measured in the frog after exposure. 
SoilType - Two different soil types were used in the study - PLE = Plott series soil and OLS = Orangeburg loamy-sand soil.
BodyBurden - Frog whole body active ingredient tissue concentration in ppm after an 8 hour exposure.
Soil - Soil active ingredient concentration in ppm after an 8 hour exposure.
Weight - Weight of amphibian in grams.
Total - Flag indicating the concentration is the total of the applied pesticide along with the active ingredient metabolites. 
Formulation - Flag indicates if the active ingredient is from a formulation = 1 or dissolved in MeOH = 0. 
Parent - Flag indicating that the active ingredient is a parent compound = 1 or a metabolite of the parent compound = 0.
