Column labels and description of the column for the csv file. 
Day - Day of testing over the course of the 2 day experiment.
Row - Position of the exposure chamber in the experiment. 
Column - Position of the exposure chamber in the experiment. 
Pesticide - Pesticide or metabolite measured in the frog after exposure. 
SoilType - Two different soil types were used in the study - PLE = Plott series soil and OLS = Orangeburg loamy-sand soil.
BodyBurden - Frog whole body active ingredient tissue concentration in ppm after an 8 hour exposure.
